- 👋  Hi, I’m @krahni
- 👀  I’m interested in developing really useable software with intuitive and ergonomic interfaces
- 🌱  I’m currently learning (again) C#/Xamarin after 30 years of C, PHP, JavaScript ...
- 💞️  I’m looking to collaborate on slim, fast, secure and stable apps without feature-overkill - which simply do their useful daily job
- 📫  How to reach me ... for now let it be github@krahni.net
